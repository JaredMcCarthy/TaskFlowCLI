# TaskFlowCLI

## About

TaskFlowCLI is a simple Python project that runs directly from the terminal.  
It helps manage basic tasks like adding, listing, and marking them as done.  
All data is stored in local text files, keeping it lightweight and easy to use.

The goal is to eventually turn it into a small command-line assistant capable of automating actions, opening apps, or launching websites right from the terminal.

## Current Features

- Add, edit, delete, and list tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or pending

## Future Plans

- Automate small tasks (like opening programs or websites)
- Add note support
- Explore AI or database integrations

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaredMcCarthy/TaskFlowCLI.git
cd TaskFlowCLI
python taskflow.py
```
